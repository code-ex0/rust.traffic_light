# Traffic light

this is a try to implement traffic light

![picture of traffic light](assets/traffic_lights.png)

for this project I use a state machine

## State machine

what is a state machine?

a state machine is a finite state machine (FSM) that is a finite automaton (automaton) that is a machine that is a set of states and transitions between these states.

in my case, I use a state machine to implement traffic light

for this I use 3 different states:
- green
- orange
- red
